# 🩺 diabetes-prediction-ml-svm
This project aims to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a patient is likely to have diabetes based on key medical features. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm is used due to its high accuracy and ability to handle complex classification problems.

# 📌 Key Features
1. Comprehensive data cleaning and preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visual insights
3. Feature scaling using StandardScaler
4. Model training using SVM (Support Vector Classifier)
5. Hyperparameter tuning for better results
6. Performance evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report
7. Clean, modular, beginner-friendly code structure


# 🧠 Tech Stack
1. Python
2. NumPy
3. Pandas
4. Matplotlib / Seaborn
5. Scikit-learn

# 📊 Steps
1. Load Dataset
2. Preprocess and split data into train/test
3. Train a SVM model
4. Evaluate performance with accuracy score
5. Visualize actual vs predicted score
