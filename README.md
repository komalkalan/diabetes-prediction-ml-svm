# diabetes-prediction-ml-svm
This project aims to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a patient is likely to have diabetes based on key medical features. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm is used due to its high accuracy and ability to handle complex classification problems.

📌 Key Features
Comprehensive data cleaning and preprocessing
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visual insights
Feature scaling using StandardScaler
Model training using SVM (Support Vector Classifier)
Hyperparameter tuning for better results
Performance evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report
Clean, modular, beginner-friendly code structure
